      <!-- Main Text -->
      <article class="article">
        <p>Most professional software is developed by project teams that range in size from two to several hundred people. However, as it is clearly impossible for everyone in a large group to work together on a single problem, large teams are usually split into smaller groups responsible for developing parts of the system.</p>

        <p>Putting together a group with the right mix of technical skills, experience, and personalities is a critical management task. A good group is cohesive and has a team spirit. Members are motivated by both group success and personal achievement.</p>

        <ol class="ol">
          <li><b>The group can establish its own quality standards.</b> Because these standards are agreed upon by consensus, they are more likely to be followed.</li>
          <li><b>Individuals learn from and support each other.</b> Mutual learning minimizes ignorance and fosters growth.</li>
          <li><b>Knowledge is shared.</b> Continuity is maintained if a group member leaves.</li>
          <li><b>Refactoring and continual improvement are encouraged.</b> Members work collectively to deliver high-quality results and fix problems together.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Good project managers encourage group cohesiveness by organizing social events, promoting inclusivity, and ensuring open communication. Simple information exchange makes members feel valued and part of a group.</p>

        <p>Whether a group is effective depends on the project, the organization, and three key factors:</p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li><b>The people in the group</b> — A mix of personalities and skills ensures success.</li>
          <li><b>The group organization</b> — Roles and responsibilities should align with strengths.</li>
          <li><b>Technical and managerial communications</b> — Effective communication between team members and stakeholders is essential.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="sch3">22.3.1 Selecting Group Members</h3>
        <hr class="border-gray-300">
        <p>Creating a cohesive group involves balancing technical skills and personalities. Often, project teams are composed of existing employees rather than new hires, which can limit the manager’s choice.</p>
        <p>Groups with complementary personalities work better than those chosen purely for technical skill. Interaction-oriented people facilitate communication, detect tensions early, and promote harmony within the team.</p>

        <p>If complementary personalities cannot be chosen, managers must ensure that individual goals don’t override group objectives. Involving all members in each stage of the project helps align goals and promote ownership of decisions.</p>

        <h3 class="sch3">22.3.2 Group Organization</h3>
        <hr class="border-gray-300">
        <p>The way a group is organized affects decision-making, communication, and interaction with stakeholders. Important questions for managers include who makes technical decisions, how external communication is handled, and how remote members integrate effectively.</p>

        <p>Small groups are often informal and collaborative, while hierarchical groups have clear authority and decision-making chains. Each has strengths and weaknesses depending on team composition and project type.</p>

        <p>However, overly hierarchical structures can hinder communication and slow progress, especially when rapid technological change requires adaptability and information sharing between all levels.</p>

      <article class="article">
        <h3 class="sch3">22.3.3 Group Communications</h3>
        <hr class="border-gray-300">
        <p>Effective communication ensures that team members share information, resolve problems, and understand project goals. It also strengthens group cohesiveness and builds trust.</p>

        <p>Communication effectiveness depends on factors such as group size, structure, composition, physical environment, and communication channels used (e.g., meetings, emails, or online collaboration tools).</p>

        <p>Project managers should promote two-way communication to foster discussion, mutual understanding, and problem-solving. Tools like wikis, blogs, and instant messaging can enhance collaboration, especially for distributed teams.</p>
