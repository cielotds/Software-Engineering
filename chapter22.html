        <p>Software project management is an essential part of software engineering. Projects need to be managed because professional software engineering is always subject to organizational budget and schedule constraints. The success criteria for project management obviously vary from project to project but, for most projects, important goals are:</p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li>Deliver the software to the customer at the agreed time.</li>
          <li>Keep overall costs within budget.</li>
          <li>Deliver software that meets the customer's expectations.</li>
          <li>Maintain a happy and well-functioning development team.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These goals are not unique to software engineering but are the goals of all engineering projects. However, software engineering is different from other types of engineering in a number of ways that make software management particularly challenging:</p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li>
            <p class="font-semibold">The product is intangible</p>
            <p>Software cannot be seen or touched. Project managers rely on evidence rather than physical observation to assess progress.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="font-semibold">Large software projects are often ‘one-off’ projects</p>
            <p>Each project is different, so experience may not always predict new challenges—especially with rapid technological changes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="font-semibold">Software processes are variable and organization-specific</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional engineering, software processes differ widely between organizations, making it hard to predict outcomes.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Because of these issues, it is not surprising that some software projects are late, over budget, or behind schedule. In this chapter, I focus on risk management and people management. Project planning is discussed in Chapter 23.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl">22.1 Risk Management</h3>
      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <p>Risk management is one of the most important jobs for a project manager. It involves anticipating risks that might affect the project schedule or software quality, and taking action to avoid them. There are three main categories of risk:</p>

        <ol class="ol">
          <li><p class="font-semibold">Project risks</p> Affect the project schedule or resources (e.g., loss of an experienced designer).</li>
          <li><p class="font-semibold">Product risks</p> Affect the quality or performance of the software (e.g., component failure).</li>
          <li><p class="font-semibold">Business risks</p> Affect the organization (e.g., competition introducing a new product).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These risks often overlap. Losing a key developer can delay a project, reduce product quality, and hurt the business. Documenting risks and their consequences in a project plan helps minimize delays and budget problems.</p>

        <p>Common software risks include poorly defined requirements, resource estimation errors, or changing technologies. Because of these uncertainties, risk management is essential for project success.</p>

        <p>Risk management typically includes four stages:</p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li><b>Risk identification:</b> Identify possible project, product, and business risks.</li>
          <li><b>Risk analysis:</b> Assess the likelihood and consequences of these risks.</li>
          <li><b>Risk planning:</b> Develop strategies to avoid or minimize risks.</li>
          <li><b>Risk monitoring:</b> Regularly assess risks and update mitigation plans.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This process is iterative and continues throughout the project.</p>

        <p>Risk identification involves determining risks that may affect the project, product, or organization. It can be done through brainstorming or by drawing on the project manager’s experience. Common risk categories include:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li><b>Technology risks:</b> Related to software or hardware technologies used.</li>
          <li><b>People risks:</b> Related to team skills or staffing.</li>
          <li><b>Organizational risks:</b> Related to company structure or policy.</li>
          <li><b>Tools risks:</b> Related to the development tools used.</li>

        <p>Risk analysis involves assessing the probability and seriousness of each identified risk. Probabilities may be categorized as very low, low, moderate, high, or very high, while effects may be catastrophic, serious, tolerable, or insignificant.</p>
        <p>Risks are ranked according to their severity and likelihood. This helps determine which risks require the most attention. Risk assessments should be updated as the project progresses and new information becomes available.</p>

        <hr class="border-gray-300">
        <p>Risk planning involves developing strategies to manage identified risks. Plans should outline preventive actions and information to monitor.</p>

        <p>Common risk management strategies include:</p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li><b>Avoidance strategies:</b> Reduce the probability that a risk will occur.</li>
          <li><b>Minimization strategies:</b> Reduce the impact if the risk occurs.</li>
          <li><b>Contingency plans:</b> Prepare for the worst-case scenario.</li>

        <p>These approaches mirror critical system strategies: avoid, tolerate, or recover from failures.</p>

      </article>

      <article class="article">
        <p>
          The people working in a software organization are its greatest assets. It costs a lot to recruit and retain good people and it is up to software managers to ensure that the organization gets the best possible return on its investment. In successful companies, this is achieved when people are respected by the organization and are assigned responsibilities that reflect their skills and experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software project managers must understand both the technical and human aspects of development. However, technical expertise doesn’t always translate into strong people management skills. Engineers may lack the soft skills required to motivate and lead a project team. As a project manager, developing people management skills is crucial.
        </p>

        <p>Four critical factors in people management are:</p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li><b>Consistency:</b> Team members should be treated fairly and consistently so that no one feels undervalued.</li>
          <li><b>Respect:</b> Recognize different skills and give everyone an opportunity to contribute meaningfully.</li>
          <li><b>Inclusion:</b> Encourage open communication and listen to all ideas, regardless of seniority.</li>
          <li><b>Honesty:</b> Be transparent about project progress and your own knowledge. Admitting limitations builds trust.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          People management is best learned through experience. This section, and the following one on teamwork, highlight common challenges and principles for managing technical teams effectively.

      <!-- 22.2.1 Motivating People -->
      <article class="article">
        <h3 class="sch3">22.2.1 Motivating People</h3>
        <hr class="border-gray-300">
        <p>
          Motivation is key to ensuring that team members perform to the best of their abilities. It involves creating an environment that encourages people to contribute effectively. Demotivated employees may work slowly, make errors, and disengage from team goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maslow (1954) proposed that human motivation follows a hierarchy of needs — from basic survival needs to higher psychological and self-fulfillment needs.
        </p>

        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="assets/figure-22.7.png" alt="Human needs hierarchy" class="rounded-lg hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-300 mx-auto mb-2 w-72 h-auto">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600"><b>Figure 22.7</b> Human needs hierarchy</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          In a software organization, employees’ higher-level needs — social belonging, esteem, and self-realization — are most relevant. Managers can support these needs by:
        </p>

        <ol class="ol">
          <li><b>Social needs:</b> Encourage team bonding and collaboration through regular interaction, even in remote settings.</li>
          <li><b>Esteem needs:</b> Recognize achievements publicly and ensure fair compensation.</li>
          <li><b>Self-realization needs:</b> Provide autonomy, challenging tasks, and training for skill development.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Motivation problems can arise when team members face personal difficulties or when projects shift away from their interests. Managers should offer support but also ensure responsibilities are met. Sometimes, reframing tasks as opportunities for growth or providing new challenges can restore motivation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maslow’s model focuses on individual needs, but people also find motivation in shared goals and teamwork. Belonging to a cohesive, purpose-driven group is a strong motivator.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- Personality and Motivation -->
      <article class="article">
        <h3 class="sch3">Personality and Motivation</h3>
        <hr class="border-gray-300">
        <p>
          Personality types also affect motivation. Bass and Dunteman (1963) identified three main categories:
        </p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li><b>Task-oriented people:</b> Motivated by the intellectual challenge of the work itself.</li>
          <li><b>Self-oriented people:</b> Motivated by personal success and recognition; they see work as a means to achieve goals.</li>
          <li><b>Interaction-oriented people:</b> Motivated by collaboration and communication with others.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Interaction-oriented people thrive in teams, while task- and self-oriented individuals may prefer independent work. The right mix of personalities contributes to a balanced and effective development team.
        </p>

        <p>
          Motivation can shift over time — self-oriented individuals may become more collaborative when they find fulfillment in team success, and vice versa.

However, as it is clearly impossible for everyone in a large group to work together on a single problem, large teams are usually split into smaller groups responsible for developing parts of the system.</p>
        <p>Putting together a group with the right mix of technical skills, experience, and personalities is a critical management task. A good group is cohesive and has a team spirit. Members are motivated by both group success and personal achievement.</p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li><b>The group can establish its own quality standards.</b> Because these standards are agreed upon by consensus, they are more likely to be followed.</li>
          <li><b>Individuals learn from and support each other.</b> Mutual learning minimizes ignorance and fosters growth.</li>
          <li><b>Knowledge is shared.</b> Continuity is maintained if a group member leaves.</li>
          <li><b>Refactoring and continual improvement are encouraged.</b> Members work collectively to deliver high-quality results and fix problems together.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Good project managers encourage group cohesiveness by organizing social events, promoting inclusivity, and ensuring open communication. Simple information exchange makes members feel valued and part of a group.</p>
        <p>Whether a group is effective depends on the project, the organization, and three key factors:</p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li><b>The people in the group</b> — A mix of personalities and skills ensures success.</li>
          <li><b>The group organization</b> — Roles and responsibilities should align with strengths.</li>
          <li><b>Technical and managerial communications</b> — Effective communication between team members and stakeholders is essential.</li>
        </ol>

        <hr class="border-gray-300">
        <p>Creating a cohesive group involves balancing technical skills and personalities. Often, project teams are composed of existing employees rather than new hires, which can limit the manager’s choice.</p>
        <p>Groups with complementary personalities work better than those chosen purely for technical skill. Interaction-oriented people facilitate communication, detect tensions early, and promote harmony within the team.</p>
        <p>If complementary personalities cannot be chosen, managers must ensure that individual goals don’t override group objectives. Involving all members in each stage of the project helps align goals and promote ownership of decisions.</p>

        <hr class="border-gray-300">
        <p>The way a group is organized affects decision-making, communication, and interaction with stakeholders. Important questions for managers include who makes technical decisions, how external communication is handled, and how remote members integrate effectively.</p>
        <p>Small groups are often informal and collaborative, while hierarchical groups have clear authority and decision-making chains. Each has strengths and weaknesses depending on team composition and project type.</p>
        <p>However, overly hierarchical structures can hinder communication and slow progress, especially when rapid technological change requires adaptability and information sharing between all levels.</p>

        <hr class="border-gray-300">
        <p>Effective communication ensures that team members share information, resolve problems, and understand project goals. It also strengthens group cohesiveness and builds trust.</p>
        <p>Communication effectiveness depends on factors such as group size, structure, composition, physical environment, and communication channels used (e.g., meetings, emails, or online collaboration tools).</p>
        <p>Project managers should promote two-way communication to foster discussion, mutual understanding, and problem-solving. Tools like wikis, blogs, and instant messaging can enhance collaboration, especially for distributed teams.</p>
